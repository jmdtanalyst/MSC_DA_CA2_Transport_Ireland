"Dublin not a good place for bicycles 1. Dublin is a terrible place to ride a bike narrow streets large buses passing you by and almost hitting you no bicycle roads.
2. Dublin bike itself you pay 1 day plan which I would expect to be a great plan for a tourist to go around the city but if you go longer than 30 minutes you pay extra which is not a great deal."
Bad service and hidden charges Avoid at all costs First we had issues signing up then the app kept crashing and when we finally got the system to release a bike we were charged 17 euro on top of our day fee because one of the bikes wasnt docked properly even though it clicked in the lock and was standing by itself. Bikes themselves arent even in good condition. All together cost 25 euro for 1.5hr of cycling. Customer service was no help and the company clearly make profit off hidden charges and catching customers out. Much better off using one of the many private bike hires available round Dublin.
Scam The actual use of the bike while in Dublin was good however I am still getting charged for it now 4 months later. I emailed customer service and they were useless and eventually started ignoring me. Do not recommend to anyone.
No Customer Service The bikes themselves are a bit clunky but the real problem is the nonexistent customer service. The only time I heard from them was when they let me know that I needed to renew my card details. I took that opportunity to leave the service and sent a message telling them that Id paid for a subscription for my daughter so we could cycle around town together as soon as she was old enough but we couldnt release a bike from the stand with her details. And was help available No. I would like to know what type of link there is between Dublin City Council and Dublin Bikes. Can someone in the Council try to ensure this is a service city dwellers could happily use I would never recommend this service.
Terrible site. Very bad service. I subscribed for 3 days for 1 person and they charge me with 5 subscriptions. Horrible site no customer services
Dublin bike stations Hey been using Dublin bikes for the past year and I love them for the convenience my only issue is I would like for them to be expanded further from the city. For me I would love stations to be brought to Rathmines Harrolds cross and Phobsbourough and past phoenix park too. Is there any plans to expand them so you know or will it only be kept to the very city centre and if they were to be expanded where else might benefit

"How are Dublin Bikes these days Havent used them since 20182019. I found them to be okay but the stations or whatever you call them were always packed and finding a spot but I see quite a few people cycling them these days.

"Dublin cyclists what bike do I bring to Dublin Hello everyone

Ill be moving to Dublin to study at TCD this September. As of right now I live in the suburban rural USA. I own a car and am able to get to mountain bike trails gravel riding and bike parks fairly easily.

I own multiple bicycles Ive been racing and riding since age 12 and I dont know what to bring with me as I can only bring one bike. Ive seen online that Dublin has great mountain biking and gravel riding nearby although Im not sure how accessible it is without a car.

Does public transport allow bikes on board to get to trails etc

Is the road riding to die for Is the gravel great Is the mountain biking the best Id love to hear your thoughts.

 Had a big circle as part its imagery possibly symbolizing the o in the term Now TV

Is anybody going to do something I mean any protest coming about this topic Garda protest Seems like nobody cares... Maybe is because all the people affected by this situations are people not original from here and they dont care enought BC is not our country or smth.

"We need more public bikes Living in Cabra West where Dublin Bikes is something unheard of. The only way to get around is with Bleeper bikes and the rare Moby but they are pretty rare most of the times they end up packed in city centre.

Dublin City Council has said that Dublin Bikes is not profitable and that they are planning to invest more on stationless bike schemes i.e. Bleeper. But whats the point if most of the bikes end up in city centre anyway At least with Dublin Bikes they redistribute them every now and then with a van.

"When are we going to have a decent public ebike service like other capitals Looking at other European capitals such as Nice and Madrid they have vast networks of public ebike services that are affordable and make traveling long distances a breeze. In Dublin Dublin Bikes covers an extremely small part of the city and the ebike offering is cumbersome you have to order the battery carry it around and it is actually pretty slow even with the battery probably because the battery is tiny and the bike is rather heavy.

Outside city centre there are some ebike services like those Free Now bikes Tier but they are hard to find they cost an arm and a leg to hire and they are not even allowed in city centre. Having your own ebike is not an option for everyone either they are quite expensive and then hard to park in town without a huge risk of getting it stolen.

A decent ebike public service could put a lot of cars out of the road and allow people to live further away from city centre. Are there any plans for Dublin to have one"

"Brazen bike theft at work Dublin 18 Hoping this gets some traction and people might have seen or been offered this very distinct Bright green coloured bike and are able to give any helpful hint that might aid in recovering it.

On Monday 23rd of April at 1120 my friends bike got stolen at work in the South County Business park our building is between the 2 Microsoft buildings closest luas stop is Central Park.
Now stealing a bike in Dublin seems to be pretty common but the way this was done was just Brazen as fck.

The bike was parked underneath our building in our underground carpark chained with multiple heavy duty locks  chains at least 2 ART4 chainlocks as well as some smaller ones to a steel fence where more bikes are stored.
The thief must have canvased the area and waited between peoples random smoke breaks to walk into the carpark with a blowtorch  to cut through the locks. Apparently it did not take him very long. CCTV footage has him on tape since the bike was parked right in front of the camera. Gardai took a report but my friend is now without transport for his daily commute to an area with almost no regular public transport services.

I for one dont feel safe in Dublin at all I blurred out my bike... As if it would help... Im just seeing so many gangs of young thugs going around on robbed motorbikes. In the video you will see that one of the guys is openly carrying a hammer on the back of a bike. This is in phoenix park right where Garda headquarters are. The other sighting was in Ballbough and honestly I was riding my bike all around North Dublin for 3 hours and I didnt see 1 Garda.

Heres hoping everyone can share this because I think all of Ireland should be talking about the crime issue and its not just Dublin. But from where Im standing its gotten to the point that I do not want to go outside... And thats just being honest.

"Dublin Rail We are talking about the wrong thing with a metro link plan to the airport wont hold my breath about it happening anyway but if we are going to even have a plan its absolutely useless unless it includes a city loop. An unground connecting Heuston Connolly Docklands Grand Canal Tara and Pearse and loops back again which connects to a line to the airport. 

In fact if we just had a city loop it would change and improve the lives of everyone in Dublin and streamline travel in a way we desperately need but also make it a bit more easier for people outside of Dublin to get to the airport. You could while at it add a few more stops along the way like The point theatre whatever its called now near Christ Church etc...as long as you connect up those main stations. 

The problem in Dublin is cars piled up because there is no other choice for people. Stopping for footfall bikes lights buses LUAS. Its an actual mess.

A trip from say Blanchardstown to city centre as the crow flies would take a half an hour to 45 minutes so basically thats the difference an underground would make. At the moment it can take 2 hours to 2 and a half with all the congestion. So a city loop would be a good start then you could expand from there. Just that loop alone would change so much and being able to not leave the station at Hueston or perhaps not even the train would change so much for people using on that line.

As it is now the way the city is structured and everyone converging on the same level it DOES NOT work.


So in conclusion.

City Loop Now City Loop Now City Loop Now City Loop Now"

"It seems my complaining has worked A couple of months ago I asked how to report squatting It was in regards to a shop called The Bike Yard on Ryders Row in Dublin 1 just beside Parnell Street. Not only were the bikes mostly stolen by junkies and sold by the store but it was also occupied by squatters who were operating the business. Now within the last few weeks it has been shut down. Skip trucks arrived and took all the bikes and also dismantled the structures that were in place like fences and things. 

Here was my post months ago asking about how to go about reporting. Maybe I didnt have a part to play at all but it might just be a coincidence.

"How to solve the housing crisis and give Dublin room to breath  Bullet trains I have been looking into the idea of brining Japanese style bullet trains to Ireland and I didnt even know this is being considered by the government since 2020 In 2020 the Irish Government confirmed it will be launching a study into an approximately 500 km highspeed railway from Belfasthttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBelfast via Dublinhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDublin to Corkhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiCork_city and Limerickhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiLimerick2httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBelfastE28093Dublin_linecite_note2 which could cost around 15 billion.3httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBelfastE28093Dublin_linecite_note3 

Another article httpswww.buzz.ienewsirishnewshighspeedraildublinireland25580062httpswww.buzz.ienewsirishnewshighspeedraildublinireland25580062

A bullet train style system would solve multiple issues at one time. People could live happily in commuter towns and not need to cling to the inner city. This would then also free up space for those who want to live in the city and bring rent down and congestion. Then obviously the boost for population in dying towns bring youth back to them. And imagine being able to go from Cork to Dublin in one hour Of course theres the green benefits so Eamonn would be happy when he awakes.

Boost for jobs bring about a sense of pride reconnect counties bike compartments for city access.

Edit Already getting but its expensive elsewhere but that just isnt true. Belfast averages are 150k per house. Galway averages 240k. Tipp 170k. The aim is to connect existing house supply to Dublin WHILE obviously yes there is still supply issues locally. I suppose to be nit picky I should have titles this how to help solve the housing crisis but i have a flair for the dramatic.

Edit 2 Thank you for all your amazing feedback Valid points taken about limited number of stop points time to build the impact it might take away focus on building houses thinking even more outside the box with HyperloopTunnel based systems past failures like the Dublin Metro lol.

Would love to hear your thoughts and any critique because to me this should have started yesterday. I have never heard this be discussed in mainstream politics personally and I feel it should be at the forefront given the situation were in."

"Bike maintenance course Good morning all

Ive been looking all over for a course in bike maintenance anywhere in Dublin. Im having trouble though. Most sites that come up arent running them. 360 does but only during office hours. Some places have their pages come up as not available. So I actually cant find anything. 

Im hoping someone here knows one going preferably soon but can wait for Januarys intakes if needed. 

Also seeing bike mechanic courses but thats a bit over the top for what I need. 

Thanks."

"Doubts on relocating to Dublin  safety Dear Dubliners Ive been offered a job in Dublin which I couldnt refuse for different reasons. I also know Dublin a little bit from visiting it solo 2 years ago and I overall love Ireland and I think Id get on with Irish people and their humorstraightforward approach. So I accepted the offer and Im in the process of finalising the recruitment steps and soon signing the contract. 

My idea was to relocate for the lenght of the contract which is shortterm and see how it goes eventually come back to Italy if things dont work out or if the contract is not renewed which could happen and in that case it would be a more permanent relocation. So i was initially pretty enthusiastic about moving there with these safety net in mind.

However after further thinking and looking for accomodation  which is a real nightmare it seems and scams are anywhere  Im reconsidering the whole project especially in regards to the safety situation of the city. 

I currently live in an Italian middle sized city and I go out at night alone anytime even early morning in areas such as stations etc and I consider this type of personal freedom a must for a good quality of life. When I was in Dublin I didnt feel unsafe during the day but one night I had the great idea to go back to my accomodation north of the Liffey just outside the city center walking on my own and despite nothing happened to me and being only 10 pm of a Saturday night the way I felt led me to take a taxi in the following evenings. 

So I was wondering whats your personal opinionexperience on this  especially for WOMEN  and what it your approach of living the city at night. Do you walk on your own Do you take the public transport Do you ride a bike to come home with no weird encounters

OFC I dont expect Dublin to have the Italian safety standards but I dont want to end up never going out or having to always count on other peoples company. Also I would take the train to travel to the seaside towns nearby and other places in Ireland is this something normally ok for a woman small villages are more on the safe side or do I always have to live with the anxiety of watching my back ALL THE TIME 

Any feedback comment or tips related to this  or to Dublin in general for someone who is planning to move there  would be appreciated. Thank you very much"

An interesting way to tackle this. Not necessarily a bad idea as we can all agree that Dublin CC is horrifically under serviced by public toilets but why pawn it off to coffee dock operators I cant imagine this attracting that many interested parties.

I always thought it was a massive miss not to put those fancy automatic  self cleaning public toilet cubicles at each of the Dublin Bikes stand  JCDecaux do something similar in other cities."

"Getting around Dublin and Ireland without a car Hello

I just moved to Dublin a few days ago and am trying to get everything sorted. I am planning on getting a bike to move around the city even though bike lanes seem to be a bit of a mess but generally it seems like a car is the main form of transportation here.

How is it to get around Dublin with only public transportation and a bike Can you also move around and view Ireland with just trains and buses

Any experience is welcomed"
"Moving to Dublin I am planning to move to Dublin from US in a few months once the pandemic settles down of course. 
I have a job offer from a company in the silicon docks Dublin 2  area and they will take care of the visa. I am a little lost with regards to the other details and hope to get some advice from you guys. 

I planned to stay close to work but I have 5 yr old boy and I am thinking  that staying close to his school will probably be better. 

Can you please suggest any good schools in Dublin Ideally at a location which is less than  30 minutes commute from silicon docks 

I would like a 3 bedroom but need at least a 2 bedroom. Is 2500 a reasonable budget for a 3 bedroom  I tried draft.ie but I am not sure on what areas I should focus on. 

Also can I do without a car Do schools have school buses How does after school care work 

Thank you for your help.

Edit thank you so much for all your responses. You guys are super helpful. I think that living biking distance from grand canal docks would be the best for me. Ballsbridge Sandymount ranelagh rathmines Druncondra are what I am finding from google maps. Any other areas that I should also look into  Or should I exclude any from my list

"Possibly moving to Dublin for work I have some questions about rent biking nieghborhoods lifestyle 1. If I work in a specific Dublin district does it make the most sense to live in that district

2. I prefer commuting by bike how good is the cycling infrastructure and bike culture there  Or does the weather pretty much prohibit daily commutes

3. What are the vibes of each district  Whats the vibe of each area immigrants families hipsters posh etc. 

4.  Whats a good price range to look for a flat in a more central neighborhood studio or shared.  Im aware this depends on income but for example here in Madrid anywhere between 350 and 600 is considered a normal price for the city center for fulltime 20something workers.

5.  Can anyone point me to a good MovingtoDublin guide either on reddit or elsewhere


Im still not sure if Im going to take the job Im being offered.  It sounds like an adventure but Id be uprooting myself from Madrid to move to a city I barely know.  Any and all advice would be appreciated.

"Thank you Dublin I came to Dublin alone from New York City for 5 days with no itinerary looking to learn take a break from work and have some fun. Primarily using Reddit for tips I found myself in a number of wonderful pubs took the DART to Malahide and Howth hiked biked drank and ate everything in sight.

On top of this every person I met was friendly and helpful. On my first night here I went to Grogans for a pint of Guinness and started talking to a man next to me lets call him J for privacys sake. Well J and I talk for at least an hour buying each other pints the whole way. I told him that I was traveling solo and asked him for recs and he did not let me down. He gave me pub recs hiking recs and attraction recs. He told me stories of Wolfe Tone Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Salmon of Knowledge Setanta about his childhood  going to schools in the middle of Ireland what it was like to be taught by Monks and about his time in the Irish Defence Forces. After our pints he invited me to his cousins 30th birthday party where I met even more people drank laughed and toldheard even more stories for 3 more hours.

J mentioned one thing that I found both amusing and also concerning. He explained that from his perspective as a white Irish patriot he found the Irish people to be infected with the venom of widespread racism. Now I wont go into detail but Im not white and so this was concerning. J then went on to explain that despite the widespread racism he claimed the Irish people were even MORE infected with the bug of hospitality and so when it came to entertaining travelers or taking someone in the Irish people were willing to do that no matter their color creed race religion etc. this was the amusing part. 

Frankly I didnt contest because if this were true I was in that moment a victim to this very hierarchy. However it did lead to me asking myself a question that I still dont know the answer to After more than 800 years of occupation and presumably even more years than that of antiirish sentiment by the British how could such an ideology consume the people of Ireland

Anyway this post is mainly to point out that visiting Dublin has been a wonderful experience and if you are a solo traveler second guessing coming to Dublin you should definitely come to Dublin. Be open minded put down your phone have meaningful conversations be kind and empathetic and dont forget to split the G."

"Antiimmigrant antisocial behaviour Ballyfermot Good morning rDublin  Im planning to move to dublin in mid october along my wife and Im worried about this kind of events becoming more and more frequent in Dublin and surroundings Im more worried about this than finding an apartment so go figureIn one of the FB groups Im part from someone posted this event that happened at Ballyfermot and Im worried because I tend to walk and use bike a lot. Im wondering if they just target anyone or if this is specially true with immigrants specially from third world countries. Ive heard people saying its only in dublin 10 or dublin 8 dont go at night dont cross parks dont go to the suburbs or whatever  but its getting more and more frequent and happening everywhere. I hope you could give me some insight on what to do in this situation.record them ask for help just run bash their heads in with a tire ironthank you for reading and taking your time 3

The text reads freely translated slang from spanish

how are you all I wanted to tell you that I was attacked by a group of Irishmen at Ballyfermot on the West Park Grand Canal at around 715 PM I was coming back from work by bike and 5 assholes blocked my way.  They kick my bike I stop one comes to ask for money another takes out a knife which is why I let go of the bike and start running one of them starts to follow me I stop and faced him with the bikes lock  later comes another the same.  I asked for help from all the people and passerby that were there and as always nobody helped me  I thought it only happened in Argentina  then they throw my bike into the river. I was waiting for the Garda because there is a camera that filmed everything in the place and maybe make sure that it does not happen to anyone else from them.

Im an American traveling in Ireland and the UK for the next month.  I brought my bike camping supplies etc. with me.  I had arrangements to store my bike case needed for airline travel while Im here.  Ive been here for three days and I cannot get ahold of this person.  Im supposed to leave Dublin Friday morning and Im worried that I wont be able to contact him.  

Is there anyone who has a little extra storage space that could keep my bike bag for me  Its basically a large canvas bag with a solid bottom that measures about 125cm x 43cm 49 x 17.  The bag portion can be squished down so its probably about 40cm tall give or take.  

At this point I dont care if its stored inside in a garageshed or even outside if need be.  

If there is anyone with a little extra storage space or know a place where I could store this please please please let me know.  Currently my plan is to fly out on December 13th.

Thanks in advance.  

Edit Ive had some great response but due to my own stupidity I may have missed my opportunity to meet up with anyone. Got a flat tire while riding around today so was gone for a while and then accidentally fell asleep due to jetlag when I got back to the hotel. Im staying at the Charleville Lodge on North Circular Road in Phibsborough. Im on a budget so I cant offer as much as Id like to but if 30 euros would help intice someone to swing by and pick it up and store it for a few weeks please let me know.

 I knew my life was boring at the moment but seeing it on paper is wild. I know when I buy my own property and make it as a result it will be worth it but for now its tough. I dont think I have been able to convey how tired I actually am by the weekend doing two jobs and not taking days off I counted 1 day off in the whole month of May and my fear is I will burn out and it will all have been for nothing if Im short of my 100000 in savings needed. You see on 40000 the banks will only offer me 140000 in a mortgage 3.5 times earrings a cheap 1 bed in Dublin is asking price in the region of 190000 though one look at the property register which I scan weekly shows that they are selling for 230000. So to buy I need that 100000. I worked out that going for a chipper and wine to have at home 17.00 v going to the monto for byob and also saving on the bus fare with it would save me 20 euro a week or 80 a month or 960 a year certainly worth considering "

"Traffic Flow I know its coming up to Christmas but the traffic flow around Dublin has always been bad but to me its gotten way worse the last while. Sure its in the interest of all road users and to get people on public transport that the flow is optimal. 

Surely we can bring in things like allowing left turns on red if safe to do so reducing down the number of traffic lights and making them pedestrian zebra crossings or change existing lights to just flash amber indicating if a pedestrian is waiting to cross cars must stop.

Even something as basic as just looking on Google Maps looking at the red and reviewing what is going on at the junction. There is one junction around me that the pedestrian cycle is nearly 2 mins yet the green light cycle is about 3040 seconds and the junction itself for the pedestrian is not any way large scale to justify the 2 mins cycle.

Then as a cyclist this grid lock is making it fairly sketchy when commuting due to the filtering I can do it as experienced at it now but if I was starting to commute on a bike I can see why people would doing it once and giving it a miss."

I arrived in Dublin a couple of weeks ago I came from Uruguay. I realised my best option for transport due to many factors is probably cycling.

Then are there any regulations Do i have to use a helmet and those fluorescent vestsjackets or is it just an option

Any information is welcome. Oh and i know about Dublin bikes but these are useful mainly for the city centre.

"An Post is useless Im based in Dublin 16 and I order a fair bit online. In fact other than groceries pretty much everything else I purchase is online. Since I dont own a car I own a motorcycle wife has a car and I work from home I just find it far more practical. Saying this I obviously use the services of numerous courier services. From a delivery perspective Amazon sits on the top hands down while FedEx is right at the bottom yet An Post still manages to get an even lower score. Bar delivering envelopes almost every parcel delivery I get via an post results in me having to collect the parcel at a collection point due to  missed deliveries.  This happens religiously unless I am at the door waiting for them to hand me the parcel. 

Today I actually saw the post man on my security cam 2 minutes after he arrived and filled out a note. No door bell was pushed not door knocked on both my wife and I were right by the front door. I now have to figure out how to collect this parcel on Monday morning More frustrating is that I have spoken to this guy numerous times and told him that if noone answers just to throw the parcel over the rear gate which he agreed with Christ on a bike why are they so useless Are they just trying to be difficult If it was a free service then sure but it aint they get paid for the delivery so wtf should I have to collect if they fail to deliver At this point I am actually starting to believe it malicious. I mean how hard is it to push a door bell How can literally every other courier company get this right besides An Post 

Ill try their re delivery services 1st time lets see as their collection point is closed today and theres no way I can get through to them on Monday or Tuesday. What a pile of shite. Anybody else have this experience or is my Dublin eir code a Bermuda Triangle where post man fear to go 

Sorry just had to rant.

"Accepted a room in springfield tallaght. Wondering if it was a good decision or if it is ass unsafe as the internet and other people make it out to be I accepted a room with a nice family in Springfield in Tallaght and I was quite happy as the family is nice and the room was in my budget. The area is mostly just families although there are some weird people at The Square sometimes. And there is a nice LUAS stop 510min walk away Hospital. But whoever I meet whether it be people I know or random cashiers in supermarkets everyone keeps warning me about Tallaght like its some kind of Ghetto and shit goes down very frequently. i will mostly just commute to college early morning via LUAS Red Line around 7 45min ride and the return using the same around 7 in the evening.   


But with winter approaching and the sun setting really early Im just worried if I didnt jump the gun and choose to live in a place that is unnecessarily going to be stressful to live in given my commute on the Red Line Ive been followed twice already lol.  


Are there any tips people have or things I should be aware of Is biking to the City Center a better idea than the LUAS Obviously I will be alert on public transport cause Im an immigrant but idk Am I overthinking this Should I live there for a while and look for something close to the city center Please help anyone Im going bald with stress lol induced from other people watching too much youtube.   


Im too scared to join any clubs in Dublin cause they all have events till 930PM and I feel weird commuting for 45min to Tallaght at 10PM after hearing all these stories especially in winter. Walking around at 11 doesnt feel smart lol and I dont want to sound like the scared foreigner but people are making me into one."

"Moving  Getting Settled in Dublin Long Hi All 

x200B

Ive been impressed with your suggestions to those moving to Ireland and wanted to get your thoughts on places to live and how to get settled quickly. Ill be moving to Dublin in April from the US and working in the Docklands area. Im a single woman in my mid30s and Id like to find a place for about 1500 but can go up to 2200. Im also 100 ok with a studio.

x200B

Im researching locations and like the sound of postal codes 6 7 and 1 but Im still trying to get a better sense of the neighborhoods. Are there any areas that are particularly runner friendly Any spots with access to 10km of trails Id like to keep my commute under 30 minutes on public transport walking or biking which I honestly think will scare the  out of me in Dublin. The Capitol Hill area of Seattle or Del RayAlexandria in Virginia are two of my favorite neighborhoods. Both had a quirky small town feel. Where the local coffee shop baristas would know your name and youd randomly run into friends at the grocery store. Plus lots of community events going on. Is there anywhere similar in Dublin 

x200B

What are your best hacks for building a social network in Dublin Ive heard its easy to meet people but tough to build friendships. Ive moved quite a bit but in the US theres a strong community of transplants wherever you go and those form most of my friendships. What kind of activities do people do in the evenings outside of drinking Are potlucksdinner parties common Where do most events get posted Meetup Facebook elsewhere Im mainly interested in running groups hiking kayaking book clubs music I play violin poorly but like to play and happy hours.

"Thoughts about East Wall appreciated Hi all my girlfriend and I recently moved to Dublin. It was lovely so far and I am really happy that our careers have brought us here 

After spending some time in temporary housing my girlfriend and I found a place south of East Wall at the north Liffey bank Quayside Quarters. We heard that this area is quite newly developed and it seems like its not a bad place to be in.

However I read some bad things about East Wall itself. Its not like we plan on walking through there in the night but we would like to take our bikes to shop at AldiLidl there from time to time  generally at daytime but possibly also in the evening after work. 

What do you think about East Wall and possibly also about the Liffey Bank area Is going to AldiLidl something we should be cautious about

Im asking this because we dont plan on buying property in East Wall just happen to soon live close by. Id appreciate any honest input. Thanks"

Hey I posted on rireland then realized there is a Dublin subreddit.  I apologize for spamming with this personal favor... but I thought I might find some luck here.  Pretty much I will be staying in Ireland for a couple months.  i had planned on bringing my own bicycle with me but I am not sure I can fit it on the plane without getting a lot of charges over 300 in fees.  I am really tight on cash so I am looking to purchase a used bike.  Or I can provide some collateral for a bike and return it upon leaving Dublin.  Perhaps I can exchange some service for this.  I have mad mathematics and computer science skills I have my B.S. in pure mathematics and M.S. in computer science so maybe some poor soul out there needs some mathematics tutoring or wants to learn programming and would be willing to exchange this for letting me borrow a bike for some time  I have two years experience in carpentry so I can do some remodel work in a home if needed as well.  Or gardening.

"Social rugby team for next season Hi people 

I just moved here a week ago and I love the city as I will be here for a long period of time I would love to find a rugby team to play for I have been playing for 4 years in Spain but the part I enjoy the most is the social one so here is the question

Do you know which clubs could be in need of new players and also have a great social life 

I mean I love to play but my work wont allow me to attend every training session so I think the teams in the lower divisions such as Metro League 910 could suit me.

So summing up Do you know which clubs could accept a belowaverage rugby player with outstanding drinking skills

As additional info I live in Dublin 9 so anywhere in a 30 min bike ride radius would be fine for me.

"why shouldnt i buy a house in dublin Im moving to Dublin soon to join a tech firm and I am shocked at the rental prices for a 1 or 2BR.  I have some money saved enough to deposit on a small 12BR cottage and am considering buying instead.  I do feel that home prices are increasing at a slower pace compared to the skyrocketing increases in rents. When I look at the prices of rental 1600 for 1BR versus monthly mortgage 1000 for 1BR plus tax credits for home buyers etc. it seems to make financial sense to buy.

I am looking to buy in Dublin 8 Portobello Liberties etc and bike to work in Dublin 2.  I do intend to stay in the property for a few years but I also might have it rented out as early as year 34 in case I get homesick and return to the US.

"Almost got killed by a taxi driver Was cycling down clontaf road around Fairview park into town. Its a busy and fairly dangerous bit road to be on with your bike but unfortunately there is little other options if you wanna turn right at the junction. 

So I was cycling along the st on the bus lane as suddenly a mad taxi driver behind me starts honking like crazy and proceeding to overtake me with like 1cm distance to proceed to break sharply right in front of me. 

I was just barely able to skip past him by swiveling into the traffic on my right. He of course sped up and was gone. No time to catch a number plate in that moment. 

WTF is wrong with some of those taxis in Dublin There are 2 lanes for cars and one for busses and bikes. Its dangerous enough on its own without people actively trying to kill you."

"Sometimes I hate this city stolen bike rant I know Im one of many who have their bikes stolen in Dublin city and nothing makes me any different from anyone else but....

3 weeks ago I got my first ever bike in my adult life and I couldnt believe the sense of freedom I had with it. I generally walk everywhere anyways but having my new bike was amazing.

Yesterday it was stolen from me in the Dublin 1 area. I had 2 different locks on it and it was one of many bikes at the stand that the thieves were not interested in. I think she was too nice and shiny to be honest. I had a cover over the basket so she wasnt as noticeable and I honestly dont expect much to come from this post. I mostly wanted to rant about how heartbroken and incredibly angry I am that there is so much scum in this city and how they can ruin my day in a matter of minutes.

I have reported it its been shared on FB over 500 times faith in humanity slowly restoring and I will be keeping an eye on all the selling sites. I will definitely also be checking that dodge shop on Parnell Street as well for sure.

I just thought Id post photos here as at the very least I get it off my chest and very most someone might see it or be offered it to buy 2nd hand. 

Blue Martello Sutton  the flowers come off easily so were likely taken off straight away as it makes her distinctive. I also had a bag covering them so it wouldnt stand out but 2 locks and a cover didnt do the trick

"Looking for suggestions of quirky sights and locations with some odd history behind it in Dublin for an upcoming photo project. During my spare time during lockdowns Ive taken to hopping on my bike and  taking in every nook and cranny of our city. Ive found when you keep an eye out the city is home to a whole host of oddities that are easy for a Dublin native to pass by during the pre Covid hustle and bustle. For example

 The Hungry Tree Kings Inn Park  
 Love Lane the artsy one in Temple bar not the alley of the same name covered in piss...I learned that one with Google maps the hard way  
 The Monkeys Playing Billiards Stonework near The National Library  
 Smithfields Murals

Since I have to take annual leave this coming week Ive decided to make my 5k holiday that bit more engaging by photographing as many of these locations as possible and attaching a description of the most funnyeccentric facts and anecdotes to each photo. A virtual exhibition of Dublins hidden gems and history if you will. 

My question to you the people is what suggestions do you have as additions to the project Is there a spot you constantly pass by that gives you a grin but most tourists pass by Is there a little bit of Dublin history you know passed down by a loved one that cracks you up when you think about it"

"Crosbies Yard apartments...doable With the craziness of finding a proper room to let I have seen some very grim room lets for 900  1000...like with sad leaky bathrooms a flight up the stairs from a moldy depressing room kind of thing  I am looking at a place in Crosbies Yard on Ossory Road.  Yes a room facing the trains.  I have walked around and caught the general vibe.  

Sure its sketchy around there.  But I did like the quick walk to Talbot and to the train station.  There are two decent gyms nearby. Cusacks a seemingly cool pub is also a few minutes walk and the room itself is priced right has its own nice bathroom the views are grand and I come from a city where crime is off the hook and noise is brutal.  Im not too worried about the train noise but should I be  I also have a private terrace off of the bedroom.  

I come from a place where homeless junkies used to serenade me to sleep by screaming gibberish into the night sky under my window while dirt bikes roared past popping wheelies.  I slept through that.  Shootings two blocks away during the day happened occasionally and I didnt give it much thought after awhile San Francisco btw.  All that for more than this room would cost me now.  But Im used to American crime and Im new here.  But need to stay in Dublin until I can eventually figure out longer game plans on where to live.

Ive read various accounts on the crime via the walk from these apartments to Talbot.  Is it really that bad  Also what about at night  Im ok with using cabs too.  Im used to walking in crime ridden inner city areas and my whole strategy is to mind my own business and no eye contact etc.  But Im new to Dublin.  Also the Deliveroo map implies deliveries will go there just not over the canal on the East Wall part.  


This wont be my forever home.  I just need something until June..."

Either way need to plan if this is going to be in the ether until Xmas."
Second hand bikes Best place to buy reliable second hand bikes in Dublin
"Kids on bikes crimes Was recently on holiday in Dublin and my friend had two bad runins with kids teens on bikes.  First was a boy on a bike who slapped him very hard on the side of his head as he rode by I witnessed this first incident. We had been strolling and chatting along the royal canal in the evening when this happened and it was honestly pretty shocking. The kid rode by so quickly that I didnt get a good look. I believe he was with a friend who was also on a bike.

Two days later another teen on a bike slapped my friends phone from his hand then rode off with it. He said this was in broad daylight in a tourist area. He was on his own at the time.

My main question is did he just have terrible luck or are kids on bikes committing crimes a common occurrence Is there a reason why he a thirtysomething year old man was targeted We are both from the U.S. and both minorities i.e. not white of different minority groups though so Im not sure if that made himus stand out. The first incident was particularly disturbing to me as he was hit in the head and I would describe it as assault. It is such a shame bc it was his first time in Ireland and I think these two incidents probably soured his memories of Ireland."

Either way Youre probably going to want to live where the action is. This doc hopes to answer some commonly asked questions and help you get the most out of this amazing city.

General Wayfinding and Areas eg What is Dublin 6

The river Liffey neatly divides dublin into the north and southsides. dublin is also divided into smallish areas signified by a number. Dublin 1 Dublin 2 up to Dublin 24 etc except for the area around dun laoghaireRathdown southside coastal town  which isnt for some reason. Areas south of the liffey have an even area number while northside areas have an odd number. As a general rule of thumb the lower the number the more central it is. Therefore D1 short for Dublin 1 sits directly in the middle of the city on the north of the river while D2 sits across from it on the south side while D24 sits way off the south west. 

The M50 is a big Ring Road that basically defines the limits of Dublin City. living outside it is a bad idea if you dont have a car. Two canals ring the central city. Generally speaking living inside the canals is city centre just outside would be the inner suburbs and anything near the M50 would be the outer burbs.

As a very general rule of thumb rental properties are cheaper on the Northside and are more expensive the more central they are. There is a long standing perception that the northside is lower class and rough and the south side is upper class and posh which has persisted in dublin for a long time. There is some basis in fact but to be honest the real divide is more eastwest with most of the most desirable areas being on the coast of midsouth dublin.

Leafy quiet streets lined with Georgian Townhouse make up the bulk of the available places which generally tend to range from incredibly nice to almost unlivable.

How to get a place to rent

Renting in Dublin is a bit of a nightmare at the moment as demand is well beyond supply in the midrange rental market. Patience is key. dont get disheartened by failure and dismissive landlords etc. Everyone goes through it. 
www.daft.ie has a virtual monopoly on online propery listing here. It can be helpful to set up email alerts on the site to notify you everytime a new property is listed in you desired areas. When a number is provided ring the number and ask to view the apartment as soon as possible. Get to the viewing on time youd be shocked how many people turn up late. Some places do open houses which are a bit of a crapshoot but try to talk to the person letting and express interest. 

If its a standard one on one viewing then if you like the place make sure you express this clearly. It can be very helpful to have the deposit to hand and offer to pay it immediately to secure the place. As some people might be willing to take it there and then Otherwise assure the landlordagentwhatever that you can pay it asap.
The key is securing that first viewing.

NB Be careful about this. If the person you are dealing with is acting suspicious dont give them money

How to get around

Dart and Luas

Dublin kind of has a metro system that consists of the luas tram lines and the dartcommuter. Coverage is kind of spotty but if you work near one of lines then getting a place elsewhere on the line is going to make your life very handy. Expect to pay a bit extra for the privilege though. Get a leap card for extra convenience. Its a prepaid card that you can use instead of standard tickets on the luas dart and buses.

Dublin Bus

Dublin bus makes up the main strength of Dublin public transport. Coverage is pretty total but some of the quieter lines can be ridiculously irregular. Living on a primary busline is definitely a plus. Leap card works here too.

Bikes

Dublins pretty flat so in that regard its a nice city to cycle. Lane coverage is pretty good as well but you will still find some crazy dangerous spots around the place. watch out for buses Dublin has a public bike sharing scheme called Dublin bikes that is highly reccomended. 20 euro a year and free trips for the first 30 minutes which is nice because there are no places in the DB area that you cant cyle to in less than 20 minutes. continues to expand at an impressive rate.

Taxis

Are everywhere pretty varying in prices despite metering. trying ringing a taxicab to get a set price for certain journeys like to the airport from town."
"PSA Just some tips Ive learned for cycling safety on Dublin roads Maybe its just around me but after returning home its been a bit shocking at the numbers I see daily who lack basic road craft and put themselves in danger through very avoidable actions so thought Id just write this short PSA about what I see that I think puts the cyclists themselves in danger and the things that can help to make your ride safer. Hope this doesnt come across as preachy or sanctimonious. Im not trying to preach and I dont know it all. Other people Im sure will also have other great tips or suggestions.

InB4 any drivers get a hard on about the dangers imposed by cyclists. Cars vans and lorries remain far and away the biggest dangers on Irish roads today to all other road users and a cyclist would have to be going close to 100kmhr to have the same kinetic energy as a 1 tonne car doing 30kmhr.

What do I know

I started really cycling in London and turned from a daily commuter to someone doing 50K a day for fun. To do that I had to negotiate though Londons terrible roads heaving with traffic and do so long before the explosion in cycle superhighways and other cycling infrastructure. In that time Ive learned a lot about how to cycle and how you should definitely not cycle in a city and I have still knock on wood never had an accident.

Cycling on the path 

Im keeping that up after recently moving back to Dublin but its scary some of the behaviours I see. One of the worst things being all sorts of people cycling on the pavements. Now I get why people do this. As a kid I was told by my own mother that the place for a bike was on the path and that this is where Id be safer but what people perhaps dont realise is how much of a hidden entity you are if cycling on a path and how little time you can have to react if someone pulls out of a driveway or blind junction or if someone walks out from a lane or steps from their house. Today I saw someone just barely miss a car and they would have hit if the driver had not seen the cyclist just in time. The safest place for you is on the road and that leads me to the second thing Ive noticed road position.

Road Position

Always ride defensively is the mantra I go by. It seems that many cyclists think that when there isnt a bike lane the place for a bike to be is in the gutter. This is not the case. The place for a bike to be is in the safest position on the road. At times this can be to the side so cars can pass safely but often when a lane is narrow or there are cars on the opposite lane the safest place to be is in the middle of the lane dominating the lane and preventing cars from passing when there is not sufficient room to do so safely. You also dont legally have to use a bike lane if its not safe if its cluttered with slippery leaves or mud if theres cars parked in there and you need to move out etc.

It is also safer to move into the correct lane in plenty of time for making a right turn and not waiting until the last second to do so. For right turns some people also recommend the Danish or Copenhagen method where when you come to a 4 way junction including a pedestrian junction you roll through the junction and merge with the traffic on your left. Then wait for that light to go green so you are now proceeding straight but effectively youve taken a right turn. 

One of the great things about cycling is whizzing freely past blocked traffic but its often safer to pass on the right of cars when the traffic is stalled especially if there are merging roads ahead and akin to above to avoid a driver coming out suddenly. There is always more room on the right of the traffic rather than trying to squeeze down the curb. It also avoids the probability of someone who might decide to jump out of the car or taxi there and opening a door to jump on to the pavement. And on doors opening avoid the car door zone of death like the plague. Running into a car door can kill and there is not enough education on methods like the Dutch reach to mean its not a pertinent danger. Also kids animals balls etc could always come out unexpectedly from behind a parked car. 

Most drivers rely on a concept called convergent thinking where on top of normal rules of the road there are subconscious ques an unwritten set of rules that two drivers recognize and can respond to. By aligning with that thinking and treating cycling like driving you will be a much more predictable entity on the road and much much safer. Obviously obeying the lights is a key aspect to this.

Good road awareness is also good to practice. A simple glance every so often over the shoulder can tell you a lot and keep you aware of whats going on around you. Look ahead for dangers. Look through car windscreens for merging cars. If a car ahead stops be aware it could be because theyre letting someone out theres someone crossing or some other danger. Keep your eyes ahead 80 of the time and the rest be scanning around for potential danger.

Lights

Finally at this time of year it is really important to have lights but be aware of what your lights are like for other road users be they cyclists  drivers or pedestrians. There are far far too many people who think that a flashing light is a safer light. Its not. There is a reason that flashing and strobe lights are used by special forces to dazzle their targets and using them on your bike makes other people more likely to be equally dazzled make a mistake when in your presence. Flashing lights also make it harder for other road to judge your speed and direction. A flashing light can make good sense during daylight to make your existence more obvious but at night its always better to use either a constantly on light a breathing light one that goes from bright to dim or a light with a very slow flash coupled with a second which is on constantly. If you do have a full beam light stand in front of them to check it to see if its also dazzling. Theres a reason we change from full beams to dips when driving on dark country roads. 

All in all happy and safe cycling and hope to see you out there."

"Tips for moving to Dublin Hello everyone I m29 recently got a job in Dublin and am currently working from my home country. However due to my current rental agreement ending at the end of the year I hope to move to Dublin well before that.

While I really look forward to moving to Dublin I loved the city and its people during past visits I got a bit intimidated by the prices and very broad range of offers on daft.ie ranging from cheap but suspicious to amazing but insanely expensive. Moreover I saw some posts on this subreddit which saw people with a large budget struggling to find a placeget agencies to accept their offer.

That is why I was wondering if you could give me some pointers on what to look out for and keep in mind e.g. what kind of criteria agencies use whether there are any red flags that I would not know about. 

Some info about me

"Stolen bikes Hi Dublin

Myself and the missus had our bikes stolen outside the apartment block yesterday. Story below. Just wondering does anyone know any markets where they may turn up We know about the one on parnell st so will visit that on Saturday.

We only have a tiny 1 bed so they wont fit in the apartment. Used to keep mine in the hallway but management company had a hissy fit that it was an eyesore so made me put it out on the perfectly safe bike rack. The carpark is gated but the rack can be seen from the road. Both bikes were double locked. They got through the flexi locks attaching the bikes to the rack and left the remains there. They both had U locks through the rear wheel and frame and no sign of them so I can only assume they had a van or something to throw them into as they wouldnt be able to roll. No cctv in the car park unfortunately.

"Cycling vs. Taxis Hi

I recently moved to Dublin and have been loving it thus far. One of my favorite aspects about the city is the bike lanes which werent offered in the city I came from back in the US. So far cycling around the city has been fairly easy  safe  EXCEPT for some reason I seem to have perpetual problems with taxidrivers either coming preposterously close or cutting me off. 

At first I passed this off on the fact that the BusTaxi lane is either right next to or overlaps with the bike lane. However I havent had any such problems with buses  the taxis seem to be getting unreasonably close all too often.

Has anyone else had any experiences like this Is it all a coincidence or are the taxidrivers just horrendous here or is there some conspiracy among them here to run cyclists off the road
