Rideshare lift E bike My wife and I were recently in Washington DC and wanted to visit some of the museums and also the memorials we used the new E bikes with capital rideshare The bikes were easy to use and easy to get around wellbalanced and really made getting to the different places easy Make sure you know where you cannot park these bikes or you can get fined but we had a great time and it was fun We put over 20 miles on the bikes which doesnt sound like a lot but that got us all over Washington DC 
Ridiculous and ancient method of bike sharing registration Attempted to have electronic and or regular bikes from capital bikeshare during a family visit to Washington dc Did not have tremendous amount of time and registering to pick up the bikes was extremely inconvenient When attempting to set up an account age verification was acquired and required someone to scroll back through the years by month to their birth date That was enough for me and I gave up and took another form of Transit
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE COMPANYCHARGED ME 250 FOR THE BIKE I rented a bike from this company that broke during my ride  i was miles away from a station to park it so I told the customer service agent i would be leaving it on the street corner to be picked up by them  They proceeded to charge me 250 for the bike  I told them i was not able to return the bike to a station as it was broken and to have someone pick it up they said ok and then charged me 250  I escalated to a manager Austin who was rude and told me that the system already charged it and its done  TERRIBLEdont ever use these bikes  Beware
Convenient and fun but here are some lessons learned So getting around DC on a bike is great plenty of paths In fact my 18 yr old son and I exclusively used bikes this past weekend Doable because we were just going for one night and we packed light with just a backpack each Using the CaBi system  Also great but the tricks in maximizing your dollar were a learning curve We got on bikes right from Reagan airport Kiosk was tricky to find but  basically just walk all the way across the parking garage and youll see it  I knew you could unlock up to 2 bikes on one account so I opened the app and bought an 8 24hr pass No clear indication on how to rent a second bike with the app so I figured Id just get my sons app set up and do a second 24hr pass The app was giving errors on my sons phone so instead of the app I bought another pass with just my credit card We wanted to use ebikes You cant get an ebike with a credit card Only the app  So I let him use my ebike and I took a traditional bike  HUGE difference LOL but anywayafter a few rentals throughout the day it wasnt until that evening that I happened to noticed the icon on the app that showed a persons head I clicked on it looking for some other info on my account and realized THAT is where you can invite a friend for only a 1 So wish I had known that because not only would we not have paid for two 24hr passes we BOTH could have had ebikes the whole time Anyway once we figured out the ebike sitch thats what we rode the rest of the weekend BUT ALSO it wasnt super clear how the ebike fees worked I had to dig really deep on the app and even then it was worded very poorly to discover that the ebikes charge per minute 05 for passholders 15 for a la carte  I mean we much preferred getting around on bikes even compared to Metro and it was a gorgeous fall weather weekend but ended up spending at least 30 both days for ebike fees  Im not complaining about he cost I just felt the explanation of pricing super unclear SO THE LESSONS LEARNED 1 use the app 2 dont buy two 24hr passes instead invite your 1 on each ride using the app NOTE YOU NEED TO INVITE THEM FIRST AND UNLOCK THEIR BIKE BEFORE UNLOCKING YOUR BIKE  you cant start you ride and then invite them after
"Walk instead Walk dont bike Docking stations dont work I was charged 250 for a bike I returned but didnt register with their malfunctioning docking station They accused me of stealing the bike I just filed a claim with the BBB Their customer service is nonexistent Now fighting this with my credit card
Also app tells you theres space at a docking station when there is none I rode to 3 different stations
Dont use"
"The gray Capital Bikeshare bikes are extremely based Growing up in DC I never cared for the Capital Bikeshare The red bikes are slow and the black ebikes are barely useful However once they dropped the new gray ebikes they actually won me over

As someone without a car I find that they are a great alternative to the slowass buses for shortmedium trips For example one trip that usually takes 1 hour by bus including waiting now only takes 20 minutes by ebike Ill also use the red bikes if the buses arent coming especially since theyre free with the membership 

Additionally the improved bike infrastructure around town is also great It makes it easier and safer to travel around by bike"
"Capital Bikeshare is apparently really cheap I recently rented a citibike in New York and was about to post on their forum asking why its so expensive There a 30 min ride costs 449 then 026min after that For an hour ride thats about 12 two hours would be almost 30 For reference Capital Bikeshare is 1 to unlock and then 005min after that so 250 for 30 mins 4 an hour or 7 for 2 hours 

But then I did some searching and it looks like all the other major bikeshare services are way more expensive than CaBi Chicagos Divvy is 1 to start but then 017min Bostons blue bikes is 3 for the first 30 mins but then 430 mins after that here the cost of an additional 30 mins is just 150 Portlands is 1 to unlock and then 030min Indego in Philly doesnt seem to have a pay per ride option but even with the pass it starts charging you 020min at one point and their day pass is almost twice the price of DCs 

In short it looks like every other major city in the US has bikeshare thats 26 times more expensive then CaBi and I just thought that was super interesting Is CaBi just more heavily subsidized Or is it better at recouping costs because of higher usage Anything else at play here

Edit 
I dug deeper into this rabbit hole and it looks like over the past few years Capital Bikeshare has recouped around 3545 of its operating cost with ride fees  httpswwwbikearlingtoncomwpcontentuploads202204FY21SummaryReportonCapitalBikeshareFINALpdf  NYC doesnt publish its operating expenses but it does publish revenues 106 million in 2022  httpsmotmarketingwhitelabelprods3amazonawscomnycDecember2022CitiBikeMonthlyReportpdf  If the operating cost per station was the same as DC abt 16300 that means their total expenses for their 1700 stations would be about 30 million ie they make over 60 million in profit Im sure that isnt exactly right but the system there certainly is making money Chicago seems to sort of teeter on the edge of paying for itself I couldnt find reliable financial statements but half the articles from the past few years say it had an operating loss and the other half say it had an operating gain Couldnt find too much for the other cities but yeah it seems to just boil down to subsidies bikeshare here is run as a public good and not forprofit and apparently thats not the case in most places"

"Is Capital Bikeshare getting worse recently I have always spoke highly of the Capital Bikeshare program I use it nearly everyday to get to and from work as well as to social events However lately I feel like the program is going downhill even as the new electric bikes have really improved my commute 

First I feel like the electric bikes are getting stuck in the stations too often Just today there were five electric bikes available at my closet stop but they all were stuck After scanning the QR code they make all kinds of noise as if to unlock but never do Is there any way I can fix this myself

Second Ive noticed a lot of improper uses of the bikes Ive seen them in homeless camps so most likely stolen and being used a toys by kids The new electric bikes have only been out a few months but Ive witness a couple times in the last week some of them damaged beyond repair 

It is such a great thing for the community How can we ensure proper regulation"

"Capital Bikeshare grace period Im sure its wishful thinking but is there any grace period when parking an ebike not at a docking station

For example can I take one to the store end my ride go inside pick up my order and say 3 minutes later start a new ride without paying the 2 parking fee  Or is there no way to do a round trip without an extra fee"
"New rules for Capital Bikeshare I let my Bikeshare ride idle for about 30 min while I got a drink on the MBT at Dew Drop 

I never docked the bike but I never ended the ride It was simply on its kickstand next to my table But when I was ready to leave after my drink the bike was disabled 

I called CaBi and the bikes auto lock after 30 min of not moving even if you are still connected via Bluetooth and still with the bike 

I was asked to return the bike to a dock for a onetime 25 refund but moving forward its nonrefundable 

Whats crazy is my bike was also dead ebike and so I couldnt rerent it to return it to a dock I had to drag the disabledlocked bike a quarter mile to the next dock The back tire dragging the whole time The things Ill do for 25 I guess 

The agent on the pone was kind but said this is a new rule that will be strictly enforced

Is this true Anyone else had this happens"
Question re Capital Bikeshare for Anacostia River Trail Hi friends I recently moved to Navy Yard and have really enjoyed biking the Anacostia River Trail I dont plan to go too often maybe 10 times this summer so I dont want to invest in my own bike I was curious if you recommend the Capital Bikeshare 8 unlimited monthly pass for biking longer distances on the ART The 45 min limit to return the bike and recheck out is kind of annoying
Capital Bikeshare has been atrocious recently Most racks have a slew of broken stalls that havent been serviced in months Theres almost no availability in NW DC I contacted customer service twice to remove a broken bike from the rack by my house and they havent done anything
Why no Capital Bikeshare BrookmontGlen Echo Heights Anyone know why there is no captial bikeshare  just over the DC line in the Glen Echo area Itd make commuting from dc so much easier with the ebikes Is it some NIMBY thing Thanks

"Stolen Capital BikeshareGoing to be charged 1200 help Last week I was late for a date with a friend and ended up taking a bike to the zoo to meet her I stupidly assumed the bikes were like a scooter and left it in Cleveland park catching the next bus instead because it would be quicker  The bike was then taken by someone I reported the incident with capital bikeshare and Lyft 

Last week I was told I have until tomorrow to return the stolen bike or else I am going to be charged 1200 I have been searching for it every day and I dont know what to do 

Has anyone else been screwed over like this If so what did you do Yes it was my fault for not knowing how the bike system works but the bike was taken I feel awful digging myself this deep"

"Huge Shoutout to Capital Bikeshare for Making 2020 Manageable  As 2020 comes to a close there is little to be thankful for But it is important to look at this last year and find some good in it While looking back I realized how thankful I am for Capital Bikeshare Before COVID hit I mainly traveled around the city via metro bus or Uber Suddenly all my options were inaccessible Luckily I am in a city that has made progress becoming bike friendly 

I suddenly found myself riding a bike daily Living in a basement studio means it is important to get out of the house As summer rolled on and initial restrictions subsided its how I met up with friends visited parts of the city went to work small office so I was only person going in etc DC is very bike friendly and small Almost everywhere I wanted to go ended up being less than a 30minute bike ride But even further trips are achievable Columbia Heights to Alexandria is only an hour on a bike who would have thought

I am critical of plenty DC government activities but I think they are doing a fairly good job with this one I see more and more bike lanes being added all over the city many of them protected Capital Bikes has 4500 Bikes and 500 Stations and they partnered with Lyft and introduced ebikes that can dock at the station Those are amazing Not the best for exercise but the red ones seem so heavy and slow after the ebike experience It is also by far the most costeffective form of transportation I used 85 for the year is amazing and they offer affordable pricing for lowincome individuals as well 

I could go on and on about how much I have enjoyed biking It leads to a healthier population a greener city better road safety and management It is refreshing to see bike lanes continuedly added to the city and the stations almost always had plenty of working bikes available I am sure that there are issues with the program or more DC could be doing to accelerate a bike friendly city but when looking at 2020 I am grateful to live in a city with such an accessible program"

Thanks"

"Your wish list for Capital Bikeshare expansion Capital Bikeshare has been in innovation mode lately Bike Angels who supposedly help balance stations Too soon to tell how thats working I still have a really hard time finding a bike when I want one and a dock when I want one The rollout of electricassist bikes Do you get a special prize if you ever actually spot one in the wild

If you could wave a magic wand and have CaBi cater to your needs what would be on your wish list

Id request the following new docks

 On the side of Union Station next to the Metro entrance The current hike across the portico is long and sweaty

 Next to the Trader Joes in NoMa The current closest docks are on the opposite side of Union Market and somewhere kindanear the NoMa Metro station each a good 10minute walk

 Next to the Whole Foods on H St The dock on the opposite side of the street is always deserted in the morning and full after 430pm There are about 1000 new apartment units within a threeblock radius and more coming online

Additionally Id like CaBi scooters that would be roped into the yearly membership fee Maybe have tiered membership levels for bikeonly and bike  scooter The current crop of scooters will bankrupt you if you use them often enough

"Missing Bike from Capital Bikeshare On 6819 my two friends and I each rented bikes from Capital Bikeshare After we used the bikes we dropped them off at the docking station on 1400 and Rhode Island at around 1150 PM  Capital Bikeshare notified us that one of the bikes was not returned and that we owe a 1200 fee We obviously are not trying to pay for the fee If anyone sees a bike with the code number of w23380 please let me know

"Capital bikeshare tips Hey everyone

Ive been in DC about nine months now and have only used Capital bikeshare once so Im pretty ignorant on the issue A few things

1 Are there any places that rent helmets I dont bike enough to buy my own helmet and I dont want to have to haul it around after my bike ride but I absolutely should be wearing one  are there any places where I can rent helmets and drop them off somewhere

2 I want to go into DC for at least a few hours on July 4th but I imagine the uberslyfts will cost a fortune and the metro will be crazy I live near the Air Force Memorial in Arlington  is there a doable bike path between say the Lincoln Memorial and the Air Force Memorial Is it safe welllit worth biking at night

Can someone take pity on me and explain this I feel like such an idiot 10 years in this city and I cant figure out how to get a bike Im ashamed of myself right now "

"Capital Bikeshare Question Hello


Quick question regarding the use of a 24hour Capital Bikeshare pass I know the first 30 minutes of a trip is free but lets say it takes me 20 minutes to bike from chinatown to the Washington monument If I dock my bike and do a bit of sightseeing and walking around and then go to the bikeshare kiosk to check out another bike will I get another round of 30 minutes for free Or will it be a continuation of my 20 minutes and leave me with 10 minutes left before I start to get charged


If it is the former does that mean I can hypothetically do 10 free trips in a 24hour period of they are all under half an hour"

"In Praise of the MBT Since 2014 I have lived in Manor Park between the Fort Totten and Takoma metro stations and  have always been an avid bus and metro person only finally buying a car in 2019 after 11 years in DC While I would use Capital Bikeshare while closer in downtown and around the Mall it felt too scary to bike very often in my neighborhood because I live near where angry MD drivers come into DC on New Hampshire and we had no bike lanes and few Bikeshare stations Fast forward to today and now I have Bikeshare station 2 blocks from my house and an offroad protected bike lane all the way from Fort Totten down to Union Market via the Metropolitan Branch Trail It makes me so happy and feels like real if imperfect progress More often than not my partner and I can score ebikes and we frequently use the MBT to go and see movies at the Alamo Drafthouse Every time we host guests from out of town now we prioritize taking them on the MBT to get food or drinks at Union Market The trail is filled with adults kids dogs bikes scooters runners walkers etc Everyone looks so happy people are often grinning from ear to ear on the trail On our trip down today there was a man painting  en plein aire  on Alethia Tanner park and a family was holding a big birthday party for one of their kids I genuinely feel like Im more connected to the local DC community when I use the MBT 

Im so much looking forward to more of the MBT protected infrastructure opening up in the next couple of years and to also buying an ebike so we can replace even more car trips with bike trips"

Heres the TLDR Want to be able to shout words into the air and learn the status or location of Capital Bikeshare stations PM me or email me at adminbikeshareinfocommailtoadminbikeshareinfocom

Hi everyone I wrote an app for Google Assistant and for Alexa which will tell you the number of bikes or docks at a station in DC For example on your way out the door you could ask your Amazon Echo

Get the number of bikes at LeDroit Park from Bikeshare Info

so you know whether or not you can head straight to your usual station or if you need to go to your secondary station or tertiary station Likewise if you had headphones that allowed you to talk to your Google Assistantenabled phone you could ask it during your ride

How many docks are at DuPont

to see whether you might instead head to the DuPont South station without taking your phone out to look

Additionally if youre planning a trip somewhere or just need to know where some nearby stations are you could ask Bikeshare Info

What are the stations closest to Meridian Hill Park

and hear that the 15th  W the 15th  Euclid and the 14th  Belmont Street stations are closest to Meridian Hill Park

I think I have the kinks of it all worked out but I also know how it works so itd be nice to get some outside feedbackperspective on what Ive done before sending it out into the wild If youre interested in testing it out send me a PM or email me at adminbikeshareinfocommailtoadminbikeshareinfocom and let me know youd like to test Or if you are just interested in updates but dont want to test PM meemail me that and Ill try to remember to ping you when its ready to go

Finnnnnnnnally theres a little data work Each Capital Bikeshare station there are nearly 500 needs a sensible name or names No one wants to say How many bikes are at M St  Deleware Ave NE for the station thats just south of the NoMa MetroNoMa Metro is probably a much better name

If you have a suggestion for what to be able to call a Capital Bikeshare station

 Go to bikeshareinfocomhttpswwwbikeshareinfocom

 Click on Capital Bikeshare

 Type in the station you want to suggest a new name for

"GF too short for capital bikeshare any other rentals open into the evening Hi all

My gf is visiting DC for the week and we were all psyched to use the capital bikeshare bikes to go on a nighttime ride around the city when we discovered shes too short to use them Even with the seat all the way down she was too short to use it Pretty ridiculous 

Anyways were trying to find some way to still go on the nighttime ride around the city but every regular bike rental place Ive found in DC closes at 7

Anyone have tips on a place that lets you rent into the evening Even 9 would be better than what weve found so far Thanks

Edit Thanks for all of the answers yall I really appreciate it"

"Missing CaBi Bike So long story  short story my Capital Bikeshare bike was stolen off 14th and Riggs on Sunday 

I stopped for a second outside the Amazon Fresh and from my line of sight the bike was taken Thief was so fast I didnt even catch the moment when it happened 

Kind of freaking of because of the 1200 policy and have already looked at previous posts on the same subject

All to say I dont need a speech about being irresponsible but would appreciate if anyone had helpful advice about somehow tracking it down

Im almost definitely SOL but thought Id shout into the void one last time to see what the internet might provide"

"Addicted to the Green  Over the last few months I have become addicted to the green It gives me a sense of freedom and speed that is hard to match I used to rely on the red or black as outlets for my needs but now I find myself gravitating to the glorious green machines The thrill is unmatched the availability unrivaled the experience consistent The main downside is cost as it is more expensive than the alternatives but I find myself justifying almost daily use 

The Lime EBikes throughout the city have become my go to method of travel I use them for my work commute only going to the bus or metro in bad weather Grocery shopping jump on the bike going to the gym oh look what is right outside my door meeting up with friends never need to worry about traffic It is often the quickest method for me to get to my destination And the best part is its fun 

The only kicker is that it is pretty pricey Costs about 850 for a 20 minute ride The black Capital Bikeshare bikes are just too scarce to rely on and the red ones are a miserable experience for longer rides compared to the ebikes Bus and metro have plenty of downsides when compared to the green bike but they are definitely more affordable The ability to get almost anywhere in the city in 30 minutes or less is just intoxicating I cant stop using them Excited for the proposed Ebike rebate because the only thing that may kick this addiction is getting a bike of my own May have to get a green one though in honor of the Limes that started this love"

"alternatives to metro Hello all
As I sit here waiting 12 minutes for a rushhour Red Line train I am currently fantasizing about alternative modes of transportation biking mainly My budget doesnt allow for me to buy a car at the moment nor am I able to walk to work But biking might be an actual viable alternative There is a Capital Bikeshare close to me but Im not really sure where to start Should I buy my own bike What do I need Is it doable Let me know what you think Thanks"
"Mobike sucks in general and if you are taller than 5 6 do not bother I have been a Capital Bikeshare user for nearly two years and those bikes occasionally have an issue but I have tried Mobike 4 times and all four of them had problems with the shifter that made them nearly useless  

I have tried every bike sharing service in the city and the only dockless system I really like is Jump but you pay a bit more for that electric boost  The rest of them are using tires that are too small and the bikes just feel awkward and a bit unstable  

As a person who uses a bike almost every day in this city I would prefer to see a dockless CapBike system since those bikes work and they have a solid infrastruture in place to keep them running smoothly 

I am sure some will disagree with me so I look forward to seeing what you think "
"Scooter and Bike Rental Success Rate has gotten awful Family and I tried to scoot around last week and our success rate on rentals in MAJOR tourist areas was WAY below 33 we live downtown and cruised the Mall Cap Hill Georgetown AdMo Rock Creek etc  The best luck we had was with Capital Bikeshare traditional bikes because you can at least have your pick of the litter without having to walk to 10 different corners to find a working rental

What I mean by that is only 1 in 3 had a charge was actually accessible could be unlockedthe new locks are finnicky and was in working orderI mean they are literally inoperable Ill ride a janky bikescooter to get from A to B  

This is a huge mistake following on 2 years of the next generation of doublespeaking yuppies moving farther from their office and using less public transport 

What DC residents actually need is to geofence out of state vehicles take one travel or parking lane from EVERY SINGLE major Road and make it for protected mixed use paths or even scooterbike parking  I want to see a pile of inoperable cars at the entrance to the 12th Street tunnel and at Beach Drive because they arent allowed on the mall or in the park"
"Union Station Bike Parking If I wanted to park my bike by Union Station where would be the most secure place to do so

I currently ride my bike on my daily commute but with the weather getting colder Id like to stop at Union Station the closest station to me to use the metro for the remainder of the commute Id rather not bring it onto the metro with me if I can avoid it so if there is a place I can leave it near the station without worrying too much about theft that would be ideal"

Thanks everyone"
"Bikeshare not docked  Can someone dock it I am visiting DC from out of town and tried the Bikeshare for the first time today I got a notification that the bike I rode wasnt docked even though I saw a green light

x200B

Would someone in the area be able to dock it for me It is at the Bikeshare station near the StadiumArmory metro station 19th and Capital The bike is W20183 and it was towards the right side of the docking station about 35 spaces from the kiosk to the left of the space I think They are threatening to charge my card with a lost bike fee if its not docked and I have no way of getting back there since I am leaving DC soon

"Shoutout to Mayor Bowser I took today off work so I stopped by The Diner in Adams Morgan for lunch A couple minutes later I saw a Black Suburban pull up and Mayor Bowser walk in and take a seat towards the rear of the restaurant She was only accompanied by a couple of bodyguards who waited up by the entrance and mostly out of the way Turns out she was there meeting Rashad Young the DC City Administrator who was also very kind and pleasant A couple of patrons literally 2 others recognized her and shook her hand but she was thankfully mostly left alone

After waiting for a couple minutes to see if anyone else was joining them or to see if she was busy I walked over and introduced myself I apologized for the interruption but mentioned that I was very happy to meet her and that I appreciated a lot of the work she was doing especially regarding Metro in DC I mentioned my use of Capital Bikeshare and she was happy to hear that I was a big fan of public transport and said she would keep fighting for improved public transit infrastructure I wanted to mention DC Statehood but I didnt want to further interrupt or delay her meeting with City Administrator Young I closed out by thanking her for her time and the opportunity to speak and she was very gracious about the entire conversation

Overall the conversation was very pleasant she was extremely approachable and definitely appreciative of kind words especially in todays political climate I was very impressed with her and just wanted to put out a kind word"

"Found a Kindle on a Bikeshare bike First of all this is super late  Genuine apologies to the owner if youre out there

"Which neighborhood to stay in Visiting for a long weekend My girlfriend and I are planning on visiting Washington in late April Were looking to rent an AirBNB apartment but neither one of us has been to DC in a decade and we arent sure where to look What neighborhood would you recommend About us

 Were a couple in our mid 20s We like quiet bakeries in the mornings cool restaurants and chill bars at night We also want to be close to the Mall Being able to walk to these places would be great
 Well be taking Boltbus down from NYC where we live and well be bringing our bikes Wed love to use the Capital Bikeshare but the bikes are heavy and we love our own

"Boyfriend may be getting a job in Lanham MD Anyone have any neighborhood recommendations I realize this is far out so apologies ahead of time but this community seems a bit more active than say rSilverSpring Where I live 

My boyfriend is considering a job in Lanham currently lives in Shirlington and so would have to move He is looking for a place with access to capital bikeshare a place to do potteryart walkable community affordable housing ideally 12k for a 1 bedroom or less etc 

I KNOW this is a fantasy list so any place with two of these would be fine to recommend Im just trying to get an idea of what the communities are like out that way 

Atm he lives in Shrilington and is I think dreading leaving the arts scene in Alexandria and the easy bikeability 

I think this sounds like Hyattsville especially since Pyramid Atlantic moved there but I want to make sure were not missing any other nice neighborhoods Metro access isnt necessary as he has a car 

Thanks "
"Homeless culture in DC is aggressive when I help them Back in late 2020 when I was in the Trinidad area in Northeast DC at West Virginia Av doing Uber Eats deliveries on a ebike I was in the middle of dropping of a food order and on my way to do another Uber Eats order until a homeless person walked up to me saying stuff like Thats an impressive job you working for I thanked him for the compliment and said that Its a simple job to work for Easy money He said stuff about keep doing what I do and since I was a nice person he wanted me to do a favor for me 

After I dropped off the food I asked the homeless person What is the favor He tells me a long story about her daughter or granddaughter Its been a while I might misheard is running low on diapers and he is wondering if I could buy it for him He tried going to the Whole Foods at H St NE but they dont have the specific kind for his granddaughter size or texture whatever it was I was gonna go to that store but I didnt understand him and told me not to go there So I decided to pay him in cash but the only problem is that I dont have cash on me and I prefer a feefree ATM I dont like being charged a fee at a random ATM 711 was a 5 minute bike ride away I asked the homeless guy If you can wait 10 minutes Ill be right back and give you the money He refused and told me to go to a ATM by the ghetto convenience store close where I dropped off the food I told this dude multiple times that I cant because I dont trust ghetto ATMs He kind of got aggressive to me kinda going back and forth towards me that hes desperate 

He also suggested me that I could come with him and his friend to drive up to a warehouse in Maryland to go buy the diapers for him Hell no Im not going with you Im not heading that direction I yelled I dont know if the driver will kidnap me I was being a 18yearold young adult at the time Now Im 21 And when I asked him where in Maryland he doesnt know where which seems sketchy Theres literally no point of me docking my bike in DC and hanging out with this guy in the middle of a food delivery Then he suggested hell cover my fee by giving him cash that he has right now and asked multiple times to go to the ghetto convenience store 

At this point I shouldve leave and ride my bike away but I was in a pressured situation and felt bad at the time that I definitely would help out I didnt have enough discipline to say no abruptly ride away and ignore to the homeless guy Im also autistic so I dont know how to be strict in the real worldpublic setting yet at the time Did I mention I was riding electric bike from Capital Bikeshare 

I left the ebike in front of the store and not lock it up and the homeless guy hold my bag for me and I asked him how much he got left to cover the fee after being hesitant to put my card to the ATM Id like to point out that I even checked to see if the ATM doesnt have a skimmer so that way I wont get scammed in the middle of work  He told me that he has 150 with a nervous smile and laugh And I was like Im not gonna do this you couldve been patient with me and waited for me for 10 minutes to grab your money Talk about somebody theyll cover my fee with no money and no home  I added But I had no other choice but to give the money to the homeless person even after the dilemma And his response was nothing but thats great that you verified the money to see if its real cool 

He handed my bag walked out and he didnt even say thank you to me I shouted Youre welcome waiting for his response saying thank you no response back It seems like to me that I got scammed from a homeless person And worst thing about it is that he dont learn his manners Talk about aggressive homeless culture in DC I fucking hate it I also dont like the homeless people asking for more stuff after I help them Its annoying 

The lesson in this if a panhandler came up to you and ask for help as well a enticepersuade you to help them please ignore them Especially if youre in the middle of something Its literally not worth 15 minutes of my time wasted in the middle of a delivery to come help the dude The ghetto convenience store that I mentioned is in the corner of West Virginia Av and Mt Olivet Rd"

Free 30day membership on Capital Bike Share for all DC residents due to Metro delays 
Probably not the best idea 
DC permitting more than twice the current number of scooters  dockless bikes for next year 
I have a question about biking in DC Im traveling with a group of teens to DC next month Is it safe to bring our own bikes to get around and lock them up around DC
Well that didnt take long 
Someone will pay a fortune when realises this wasnt a dockless bike 
"Lost citibike Im hoping to get some help finding the Citi bike I was hit on last night I undocked in at 4250 Connecticut and was riding down Connecticut towards the capital area to my hostel I came to in the ambulance when someone said they found me on the street 
If someone is in that area and sees the bike Id be super grateful if you docked it for me
Im doing ok just sore today 
Thanks a bunch"

"Biking Trails for Beginners Thanks to u DRF561s PSA for the good weather I got out to Rock Creek Park today for the very first time and had an incredible time I used a Capitol Bikeshare and since I havent ridden a bike in years I found it extra difficult especially since the trails had a lot of people on them 

Im hoping to get out tomorrow since the weather will be still nice and wanted to bike again Does anyone have recommendations for good trails for beginners Bonus points if its near a Capitol Bikeshare station I love meeting new people so if you want to join Id love to ride with ya"
"should I buy a bike for fallwinter in DC Hi all

Im going to be doing an internship Sept 1 to end of December this year and was thinking about buying a bike to commute for pleasure while in town I see that there are some bikes for purchase for cheap but I just wanted to ask locals if DC is a bike friendly place both in terms of road conditions weather and bike theft and is it that much more pleasantefficient to bike around than use public transportation  

Any light you could shed on the bike culture in Washington would be much appreciated"
"Capital Bike share vs Lime vs buying your own bike Those of you that bike  how did you get into it Are you a pro or casual You do it as leisure or you commute

Im starting to develop a liking for this biking thing So far Ive been ok with bikeshare Living in the city there are plenty and its virtually free for me I like that they have baskets for when I have a bag I like that when you are done you just dock them and forget about them 

However Ive started taking them in the trail and doing 2 hr bike rides and Im now curiousis there a practical difference between the DC bikes and buying your own Is it comfort speed etc asking from ignorance to learn Like is a 500 vs a 1500 bike different for day to day city usage How do you lock bikes if the pipe is simply cut Racing bike or mountain bike Do you use motor functions

Whats stopped me from getting a bike so far is the high theft rates I live in a new apt building and if I go out with it I cant change my mind and walk metro or Uber home Is there a benefit for city biking and for city trails"

"Suggested route for visiting friends with Capital Bike Share Hi all

I have some friends visiting from out of town that are new to DC and quite honestly Im just tired of walking around the mall area

Im tempted to have them rent some bikes using Capital Bike Share but was wondering if anyone could recommend a good route

I know most of my way around the main mall area but was trying to think of ways to extend it a bit  If youre not stopping its really easy to just get through the whole area in only an hour or so"
"Cheap folding bicycles in DC Hi  Im coming to DC in midJuly for the first leg of a multicity research trip  My plan is to buy a cheapsecond hand folding bike to get around the various projects Im due to visit not all within striking distance of subway etc before taking it on with me to my later travels in the States

Can anyone advise a whether this is wise given the heat of Julycity layoutetc  and b a good shopconnect for this"
"Will be in Philly on Friday AM thinking of driving to DC on sat morning for a day trip where to park since wikitravel isnt working for me

Like the title says ill be in philly for the next week for training and wanted to make a day trip down to DC on this coming saturday to see the touristy stuff with the misses

I hear parking can be a lot like NYC or Philly and get expensive Whats the best way to park a rental car in DC for a 12 hour time frame were not afraid of metros or anything like that

I was thinking parking at union station and taking the RED line in to the city center or maybe its better to park at the greenbelt metro station and taking the GREEN line in to like the archives metro station Not being from the area i have no idea how efficient that is and how late theyll run on a sat night

The plan is to stick to the touristy stuff around the national mall capital AS museum etc

edit
after doing a bit more reading seems greenbelt fills up early on weekdays were going on saturday so im not sure how busy itll be at around 101030am on sat morning"
