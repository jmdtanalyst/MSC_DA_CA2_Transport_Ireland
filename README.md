## introduction

This data analysis project aims to analyze and compare Irish transportation data with Denmark, using various methods such as statistical analysis, machine learning and data visualization The project is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of transportation of both countries.

## Functional structure

The project is organized into the following main sections.

- **Data collection and pre-processing:** Obtaining and preparing relevant data from [Transport Infrastructure Ireland](https://data.gov.ie/organization/transport-infrastructure-ireland) and sites current.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis that looks for patterns, patterns and patterns in the data to inform subsequent analysis.


- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying descriptive and inferential statistics to summarize datasets, gain insights, and compare Ireland and Denmark.

- **Machine Learning:** Using machine learning models for prediction, classification, clustering, and sentiment analysis. Comparing and contrasting results to derive meaningful insights.

- **Data Preparation and Visualization:** Cleaning, engineering, and visualizing data to enhance the analysis.

- **Interactive Dashboard:** Developing a modern transport planning dashboard to showcase information and evidence gathered from the analysis.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for Ireland is [Transport Infrastructure Ireland](https://data.gov.ie/organization/transport-infrastructure-ireland). Additional datasets from Denmark are used for comparison. Ensure to review and comply with licensing/permissions associated with the data.

## Project Management and Version Control

The project is managed using a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo) with regular commits to track code and report versions.

## Programming and Data Exploration

The project is implemented programmatically using Python, with Jupyter Notebooks for code execution. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn are employed for data exploration, statistical analysis, and machine learning tasks.

## Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and a variety of inferential statistical techniques are used to analyze variables, find similarities between countries, and draw evidence-based conclusions.

## Machine Learning

Multiple machine learning models are employed for prediction, classification, and sentiment analysis. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using the GridSearchCV method. The project explores both supervised and unsupervised learning, including dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Data Preparation and Visualization

Raw data acquisition, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data cleaning are thoroughly documented. Visualizations aid in presenting findings, and decisions made during data preparation are justified with evidence.

## Interactive Dashboard

A modern transport planning dashboard is developed using Python libraries (Dash, Plotly) to present information and evidence gathered from the analysis. The rationale for visualization choices is detailed in the development process.
