DUBLIN




As of today, December 5, 2023, there are three bikeshare services operating in Dublin:

    Dublinbikes: This is the oldest and most well-established bikeshare service in Dublin, having been launched in 2009. It is operated by TFI Cycles, a subsidiary of the National Transport Authority (NTA). Dublinbikes has over 3,500 bikes and 450 docking stations located throughout the city center and inner suburbs.

    Bleeper: This is a stationless bikeshare service that was launched in Dublin in 2018. It is operated by Bleeper Bike, a private company. Bleeper bikes can be unlocked and locked using a smartphone app. There are currently over 800 Bleeper bikes available in Dublin.

    Moby: This is an electric bikeshare service that was launched in Dublin in 2023. It is operated by Moby Bikes, a private company. Moby bikes can be unlocked and locked using a smartphone app. There are currently over 300 Moby bikes available in Dublin.

All three bikeshare services are convenient and affordable ways to get around Dublin. Dublinbikes is the most extensive service, with the largest number of bikes and docking stations. Bleeper is a good option for shorter trips, as there are no docking stations to worry about. Moby is a good option for longer trips or for those who want the assistance of an electric bike.







BARCELONA
    Bicing is the older of the two services, having been launched in 2007. It is operated by Clear Channel and has over 6,000 bikes and 400 docking stations. Bicing is a public service and is intended for short-term journeys of up to 30 minutes.
    AMBici is a newer service that was launched in 2023. It is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) and has over 2,600 bikes and 236 docking stations. AMBici is an electric bike-sharing service and is also intended for short-term journeys of up to 30 minutes.

Both Bicing and AMbici are convenient and affordable ways to get around Barcelona. However, there are some key differences between the two services. Bicing is a more established service with a wider network of docking stations. AMbici is a newer service with a smaller network of docking stations, but it offers electric bikes.

Ultimately, the best bike-sharing service for you will depend on your individual needs. If you are looking for a convenient and affordable way to get around Barcelona for short-term journeys, then either Bicing or AMbici would be a good option.
