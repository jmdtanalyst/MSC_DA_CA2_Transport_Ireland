Amazingly brilliant customer service,"I'm not the best with computers and had some issues with my account the customer service could not have done enough for me, they talked me through everything, they were exceptionally kind & patient with me. I was very impressed with how quick they were to return all my calls and emails. The bikes are a great way to get from A to B in the city centre and way cheaper and reliable then the bus, luas, taxis, etc...they are also by far the cheapest bike service there is!",5.0
Still being charged for the bike,"Really enjoyed using but tried to return it. It locked the bike to the stand but didn't end the journey on the app. The journey is still ongoing, we are still being charged for it and we can now no longer use any bike to get around Dublin today. Really disappointing. The call centre is closed at the weekend and the website offers no advice on what to do.",1.0
Fun way to get around ,Visited Dublin over the weekend and thought this would be a fun activity for us as a couple...considering I haven't used a bike in 30 years it was a little daunting!....but so much fun and easy to use terminals ..definitely recommend for only 5 euro for a 3 day pass.  Just make sure you leave the bike back every 30 mins,5.0
Great customer experience,"Excellent customer service and user experience. I've been a Dublin Bikes customer for five years but recently cancelled my account as I have my own bike and a car so I no longer used my membership, the staff member (Mary) was great about the situation and I feel my whole experience over the past 5 years has been great. I lost my card once and it was replaced very quickly and bikes are usually in full working order and memberships are very affordable.",5.0
Hhhh,Bad costumer service. They don’t return calls and they don’t answer emails. and explained that I couldn’t pay .50 cents because their website is faulty and my anual subscription was cancelled because of that. The girl told me to contact my bank after trying 3 different cards with no success. I am still waiting someone to get back to me or answer my emails.I won't recommend anyone to use their services Keep away from them no one like to be stressed,1.0
Bad costumer service,Bad costumer service. They don’t return calls and they don’t answer emails. I run Dublinbikes on 25/02/21 and explained that I couldn’t pay .50 cents because their website is faulty and my anual subscription was cancelled because of that.

"Always rains in Dublin,  So cant really use it a lot.",BEWARE!!! Cant believe the Irish Government is allowing this to happen. Once you sign up you cannot cancel. The emails come from NO REPLY emails. And there is no phone number or even email to cancel the subscription. I only used it twice for which 25 Euros was very expensive and never been able to cancel for 2 years. Worse ever City Council service.,1.0
No Customer Service,"The bikes themselves are a bit clunky, but the real problem is the non-existent customer service. The only time I heard from them was when they let me know that I needed to renew my card details. I took that opportunity to leave the service, and sent a message telling them that I'd paid for a subscription for my daughter so we could cycle around town together as soon as she was old enough, but we couldn't release a bike from the stand with her details. And was help available? No. I would like to know what type of link there is between Dublin City Council and Dublin Bikes. Can someone in the Council try to ensure this is a service city dwellers could happily use? I would never recommend this service.",1.0
Scam,"The actual use of the bike while in Dublin was good, however I am still getting charged for it now 4 months later. I emailed customer service and they were useless, and eventually started ignoring me. Do not recommend to anyone.",1.0
Useless App,We both tried  to register on a few occasions but error message of ‘OOPS something has gone wrong’ kept appearing. We had planned to ride in to centre from hotel but gave up frustrated and disappointed. Used trams instead which were great and hassle free.,1.0
Great way to see the sites,Got the 3 day pass for 5EUR. Great deal. ran around town and saw all the sites. You do not pay for less than 30 minutes so just park a bike and then get a new one. Easy to wander around town.,5.0
They stole my money and refused to facilitate a refund,"My card was rejected as unsuitable, but it didn't stop Dublin Bikes drawing 150 Euros out of my account and leaving me penniless for the rest of my stay in Dublin! Their helpline number didn't work so I traveled out to their head office to be bluntly told there's nothing they can do and I should take it up with my bank. Thanks for nothing Dublin Bikes.",1.0
Not worth the hassle,"I hired a bike for an afternoon touring the city, as I have knee problems and can't walk far. First bike stop, no credit card facility so couldn't get 3 day ticket. Second one, good, but took ages to work out how to work it. Ages later (with one irate person waiting) took bike. Couple hours later, wanted to dispose of bike. Didn't have the app, so took my husband 6 tries at different locations to drop stupid bike (if they're all full, you have to go to another). I couldn't have done it alone, as it's not have been able to walk all the way back from the bike drop. Then we didn't have enough time for bus tour before going. They need more bike stands in the centre!",2.0
Dublin NO Bikes,What use is a Dublin Bikes subscription when the stations are empty most times you need a bike? On the rare occasions you do when you get to your destination all stations in the area are full. We stayed in the Dublin 8 area and planned on using the bikes to go to the city centre. We ended up taking the Luas most of the time. I would not recommend Dublin Bikes.,1.0
Very bad experience with Dublin Bikes,"Visitied Dublin and wanted to obtain two 3-Day Passes with my credit card. First 3-Day Pass worked. Payment for second 3-Day Pass was accepted, but second 3-Day Pass could not be used to get a Dublin Bike. On Saturday and Sunday, helpdesk of Dublin Bikes is not available. Purchased a third 3-Day Pass, but again the payment was accepted but again the 3rd 3-Day Pass could not be used to get a bike. The we decided to give up, and continue to see Dublin on foot instead of by bike.Called the Dublin Bike helpdesk and complained. The 2nd and 3rd 3-Day Passes were credited, but Dublin Bikes refused to refund the € 5,00 for the first 3-Day Pass.Conclusion: Bad service and very bad hot line. Don't do it",1.0
Terrible site.,Very bad service. I subscribed for 3 days for 1 person and they charge me with 5 subscriptions. Horrible site no customer services,1.0
Bike Stolen - Still charged 150 euro.  Bad & Rude Customer Support,"My Dublin Bike was stolen.  Out of courtesy, I called into the Garda station, reported it, got an ID for the incident, returned the Dublin Bike key in case it was found, called Dublin Bikes to report it immediately (they didn't answer), called again and waited 20 minutes before getting through to their Customer Care team.  I was then given poor, rude support and told that I would be fined 150 euro.  If a bike is stolen because of their bad locks, they should have their own insurance to cover it rather than pinning the unfortunate Dublin Bikes user.",1.0
Sightseeing by bike,"What a great idea! When you’re fed up with the hop on hop off buses (and provided the weather is fine) why not explore the city by bike? Every way you turn you may discover bike stations with the popular Just Eat bikes waiting for you. However, as a tourist, you have to get your 3-days subscription first, which did not exactly turn out to be a walk in the park in our case. I’ve hardly ever come across such an awkward self-service system.At station 23 - Custom House - with the gleaming sun from the back rendering the unshaded low contrast screen virtually unreadable, we had to guess our way through a rather obscure subscription process. Just to find out at the end that there was a problem with the credit card reader. We tried several times before we gave up and proceeded further down the Liffey to station 8 - Custom House Quay. That one was not equipped with a credit card reader at all. So we went on to 48 - Excise Walk. No cards either.No sooner than now we discovered the map on the rear wall of the terminals indicating the bike stations accepting cards. So off we went for 65 - Convention Centre. This time everything worked quite well besides the fact that the machine wouldn’t emit the last one of the receipts. These are vital because you need the 6-digit ticket id number in addition to your pin to unlock your bike. Fortunately, I had seen that number earlier on the screen while browsing through the menu and was able to recall and write it down.Sigh, what a trouble! – On top of that, you have to be aware that Dublin Bikes will require a hefty 150 Euro guarantee for each subscription. Guarantees, although not effectively charged, do use your credit limit. Purchase bikes for a family of 4 and you will do a giant leap of 600 Euro towards your card limit. Do not expect to see those guarantees cleared during your stay in Dublin.I must admit: Proper internet research prior to stumbling into this would have saved us at least some of the trouble.But now for the sunny side: I couldn’t help inspecting some of the bikes occasionally. They all seem to be well maintained and in good condition. No flat tires and all brakes in working order. The saddles are adjustable. There are lights, a shopping basket and even a bike lock in case you need to park temporarily outside a bike station.The Dubliners seem to have gotten used to tourist bikers from mainland Europe with a strong propensity for evading to the wrong side. I never heard any honking, no matter how erratic our manoeuvres were. But be careful when you leave the pedestrian zones and dedicated bike lanes of the city centre and venture into areas with lots of traffic, especially down at the harbour where the streets are narrow and full of heavy lorries.The bikes are not made for big tours anyway. They are simple, rather heavy 3-gear city bikes which serve the purpose of getting easily from A to B within the precinct of Dublin Bikes’ countless stations very well. If you want to go farther look for something else.Be sure to download the Just Eat Dublin Bikes app for the map with all the bike stations and the services available.All in all we liked using the bikes, if not for the time saved then at least for the fun we had.",4.0
Dublin Bikes,"The bike stands are located all around the city. All you need is a bank card and a few minutes to fill out the application on the screen to get your card.There are two versions - annual or a three day pass for €5. Once you purchase this, you are free to use the bike for as long as you like.Top tip -  if you move from one stop to your destination station within 30 minutes, then the trip is absolutely free.",5.0
Uncomfortable,"I've been a customer for a good while now and have always enjoyed the service but I'm very disappointed with the introduction of the electric version: it weighs a ton, it's like trying to cycle a Honda 50, particularly the front of the bike, ie, handle bars, forks and front wheel. At times it feels like there's someone in the front basket making it difficult to go through narrow spaces eg, cycling through traffic. I hope to God they keep some of the ""manual"" ones. I arrived at stations on several occasions and there was ONLY electric ones available. If I'd have known this I wouldn't have renewed my annual subscription in March and have NO intention of doing so next year. Also, WHY DO THEY HAVE TO CLOSE SO EARLY AT NIGHT??? 🤔",2.0
They are stealing me,"They are stealing me every year around 4 years, and I tried to find out why if I cancelled it. They only say it is already cancelled but every year debit 35€ From my AIB.I'm going to find a lawyer to found out a way to resolve this.",1.0
AWFUL Customer Service,"BE AWARE! Dublinbike may charge you annual fees even if you canceled your annual subscription. Canceled my annual subscription on the 8th of Nov via email (tried to contact over the phone stayed on the line for half an half - no one picked up. Left a message no one called back). On the 11th of Nov got confirmation (via email) that my account will be closed on the date of renewal (12th of Nov). Today got email saying that my payment has been successfully received - checked my bank account - indeed I was charged. Wrote to customer service to which they replied that they will close my account now and will refund money in TWO WEEKS. To my question why I was charged in the first place and 2 weeks is unacceptable waiting time when the fault is on their side they replied nothing. Completely ignored. They didn't not accept their fault, NO APOLOGIES. Terrible customer service. BESIDES (the reason why I cancelled it in the first place) you can never have either available bikes to ride or spaces to park it.",1.0
Saturday spin,I got a bike from Kevin street cycled to Fallon & Byrne Wicklow street stand was full. Ended up cycling to far side of Stephens Green to put back bike! Met later 3 Italian tourists trying to return bikes to Wicklow street. More bike stands in Wicklow street please,2.0
Dublin Bikes,"Dublin bikes JCDecaux is an essential of getting around Dublin City. There are similar systems in other european capitals. I think the maintenance guys in Dublin are doing a really great job and the scheme is working well. The 3 day pass for visitors to Dublin City Ireland could be made subscribable online , as it is in other cities (at least one I know of) and that would really aid visitors to access the bikes more efficiently. I see a lot of them wondering how or fumbling with cards at the card enabled stations, and sometimes not succeeding in getting the 3 day pass. The maps can be improved.",4.0
"Great to visit the city, but system not perfect","I always try to rent a bike to visit a city for a couple of hours, I love it!BEWARE: not all their bike stations have the machine that accepts the credit card... then if you are a tourist and not a regular client, you need that machine to get your 3 day card type of thing.The machine is not super user friendly and it seems at some point that your payment is not working, but it will... just be patient :(.You will need to deposit 150 euros from your credit card.The bikes were in good order.We had lots of fun going to and back from Guinness Storehouse with the bikes.Good job, I would recommend using the Dublin Bikes!",4.0
Brilliant!,"I visited to celebrate the centenary.  I loaded the Android app for Dublin Bikes from Michel Gauzins.  Flawless.  First CC terminal I found wouldn't work.  Walked to another and it did.  Took my Bank of America chipped Debit card.  Must have used the bikes 30 times over the weekend.  Only one incident of finding a completely full station.  Easy enough to check the app for spaces and then ride two blocks to find another parking slot.  Once adjusted to the gearing and seat height adjustments I was on and off in a flash.  I'm a stout 67 years and had no trouble getting all around the city.  When departing, I had backpack luggage and rode from St. Stephens Green to Heuston train station in 20 minutes.",5.0
Bike your way through Dublin,EUR 5 per bike for three days and you go anywhere. Very convenient and highly recommended. Be very aware of the many many irritating busses you are trying to beat! Dublin is working on reintroducing trams to get rid of them.,5.0
Dublin is not for biking,"you have to check out online how the rental works. only few stations allow payment by credit card (you will need your pin); their map shows all the stations, but stations with credit card payment are on a list only. will take you 20 min to figure out which station close to you will allow credit card payment. bikes are in good condition. beware, when you return the bike you first have to enter your data on machine and then deposit bike; this is totally unclear when you rent a bike; no button such as ""return bike"" Dublin is not a biking city; I am an experienced biker but think Dublin is quite dangerous to bike; in particular for right hand drivers. a lot of one way streets that make navigation more tricky.",3.0
Dublin not a good place for bicycles,"1. Dublin is a terrible place to ride a bike, narrow streets, large buses passing you by and almost hitting you, no bicycle roads.2. Dublin bike itself, you pay 1 day plan, (which I would expect to be a great plan for a tourist to go around the city), but if you go longer than 30 minutes you pay extra, which is not a great deal.",1.0
Bad service and hidden charges,"Avoid at all costs! First we had issues signing up, then the app kept crashing and when we finally got the system to release a bike we were charged 17 euro on top of our day fee because one of the bikes 'wasn't docked properly' even though it clicked in the lock and was standing by itself. Bikes themselves aren't even in good condition. All together cost 25 euro for 1.5hr of cycling. Customer service was no help and the company clearly make profit off hidden charges and catching customers out. Much better off using one of the many private bike hires available round Dublin.",1.0
"Terrible bike, terrible day.","The bike is horrible. I don't know how they can legally allowed this. Going with it is a pain, it s slow and heavy, it looks like the cyclette of the gym, pedalling with it is exhausting but you stay still. Never ever more, I prefer to rent a byke from a private. There are not enough byke stations. Beware!",1.0
Great way to see the city ,Dublin bikes are a great way to navigate the city - recommend you wear a helmet as the taxis and busses don’t give you an inch! ,4.0
Good Value for Money,"5 Euros for 3 days.Great way to get around the city, and particularly the suburbs.Note: not all the bike stations have the credit card facility, so check out the website first if you can.When paying, there are a lot of stages, so pay attention to the screen until the process is complete. (You'll need to come up with your own four digit pin code).However, once issued with a 3 day ticket, access to the bike is really easy.Note: Like all bike schemes, stations have differing usage as the day passes. Some will be empty, others at destination areas will be full. When you've finished with your bike, you may not be able to park at your chosen destination, so if you see a slot in a nearby one, grab it and walk the rest.",5.0
Excellent way to get around Dublin,"As a regular user of Dublin Bikes, I cant praise them highly enough. There are plenty of locations around the city and bikes are very well maintained. It is worth noting that availability of bikes and parking spaces can be difficult during peak hours around 9am and 5pm. Download one of the Dublin Bike apps to get a realtime view of availability so you don't end up being unable to park or get a bike.",5.0
See Dublin ,"Loved the bikes, the city and the whole experience. Highly recommended. Check on line for details before you go, pray for good weather, get the €5 three day pass, and start pedaling!",5.0
The best way to see Dublin,"We ride our bikes in USA for commuting to work and thought it would be a good idea to check out Dublin bike rentals for traveling to places within Dublin. It turned out to be a great decision for multiple reasons:1. 3-day pass with no membership fee : You can walk upto bike stations and buy a 3-day pass for 5 euros. It'll place a hold but that's refundable. That's really cheap and convenient. The first 30 minutes are free for every trip and frankly, everything in the city is within 30 minute biking distance. I think it's only 0.5 euro for every 30 minute thereafter. You don't need any app!! You can check the map of cycle stations on dublin bikes webpage.2. There are plenty of bike stations around the city. It's very easy to find bikes and stations.3. It's so safe to ride cycles in the city. The drivers are so patient and cognizant of the tourists on cycles. I never heard a honk and I biked like a silly girl on wheels honestly. In USA, there's a pro-car/anti-cycle atmosphere. If a cyclist gets hit, there's a lot of victim blaming, like, was the biker wearing reflective jacket etc. In Dublin, the cyclists would zip around buses without bike lanes and it was fine! Everyone was alert and respectful on road and despite the zipping around, it felt really safe.4. It is much faster than public transport. Dublin is chalk-full of buses with cyclists just bypassing them!5. and finally!! It's so much fun to whiz around on a cycle. We made videos of us biking in Dublin! Weeeeeeeee",5.0
good way to see Dublin,"Dublin is a compact city. Easy to walk or to take a bike. For EUR 5 fee (3 day fee) you can pick up a bike at many places in the city. EUR 0,50 per half hour. Bike storage points at various places thoughout the city. Quick and easy transportation for the places which are a bit outside the city centre (Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham gaol). One point of attention. It happens often that at the end of the day the storage points in the city centre are full. This means driving to a next storage point  to return your bike.",4.0
Worth hunting out a hire station with working CC terminal,"An ever increasing number of cities have public bike hire, and the Dublin scheme covers the inner city, with a fairly dense network of hire stations, although it's a good idea to print a map off the internet first, as they are not always easy to find.  Around one third of the hire stations accept credit cards, although the first one I tried rejected all three of my cards.  Slightly disillusioned (and with a couple of hours to kill, having arrived in the city early off an overnight ferry) I tried a second station and it accepted the first card I tried.The bikes are of a design that will be familiar to renters of the Parisian Velib or London Boris bikes.  They are heavy, with a front basket, and a rather flinsy and short lock - but it's worth finding out how this works (it's a bit fiddly) if you want to stop for a coffee outside the centre zone.  As with most systems, there's a modest daily rental charge, and then the first 30 minutes of any rental are free - the trick is to get it back to a hire station within the half hour and wait for the few minutes required before taking it out again.  Even if you do go above 30 minutes (and I wanted to get to see a particular place in the inner suburbs) the second half hour is not expensive - costs start ramping up afterwards, though.There are plenty of marked bike lanes in the central area, so cycling's not too difficult (and it's flat).  It's a pity it doesn't go a little further out to the suburbs, but works well in the area it covers.",4.0
Bikes beat the bus system hands down,"We had bought a LEAP pass, which was a waste of money since we found the bus system so un-decipherable and ended up walking almost everywhere.  We only used the bikes once (from Kilmainam Gaol to Guinness) and found it super convenient....if we had known earlier we would have used them more and saved our tired feet a bit.  But do plan your route....Dublin drivers are mad!",5.0
"Great way to enjoy the villages, e.g. Ranelagh","You can get a 3-day pass and then pay for usage (reasonable).  I agree with other reviewers that not all of Dublin is ideal of casual biking, but if you stay in Ranelagh - biking along the canal is awesome!   Download the app and find the nearest station that accepts credit cards - buy the three-day pass and then select your bike.   It is very easy and quite enjoyable.",5.0
Inexpensive practical and accessible transportation in Dublin,The city bike stands are scattered all over the city with a map at each stand making it easy to pick up and drop off. The process of buying the Three Day Pass at €5 was clear and easy. If you keep the bike for under 30 min there are no extra charges. The bikes are comfortable and easy to ride with adjustable seats and baskets to hold purses etc. There are several cycle lanes but sometimes cars block them. The bikes share the bus lanes which can be somewhat unnerving. The cycle paths often just end so it can be challenging riding in traffic. In spite of that I definitely recommend the Dublin Bikes to get around the city. We were able to explore much more of the city and get from point A to point B much more quickly. A great tour.,5.0
